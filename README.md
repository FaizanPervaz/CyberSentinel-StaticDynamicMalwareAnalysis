# CyberSentinel-StaticDynamicMalwareAnalysis
 üõ°Ô∏è In-depth Static and Dynamic Malware Analysis Tool with Predictive Modeling & Reporting üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüîç

## Description
CyberSentinel is a robust tool designed to perform both static and dynamic malware analysis. It leverages advanced predictive modeling to classify executable files and scripts, determining whether they are malicious or benign. This tool also includes comprehensive reporting features for detailed analysis.

## Features
- **Static Malware Analysis**: Analyzes binary files for signatures of malware using various hashing algorithms (MD5, SHA-1, SHA-256).
- **Dynamic Malware Analysis**: Monitors and reports on the behavior of potentially malicious files during execution.
- **Predictive Modeling**: Uses machine learning models trained on a rich dataset to predict the nature of files.
- **Reporting**: Generates detailed reports on the analysis for both static and dynamic assessments.

## Usage
- **Static Analysis**: Utilize the provided scripts to calculate file hashes and extract binary file characteristics.
  Example usage: python static_analysis.py <file_path>
- **Dynamic Analysis**: Run the dynamic analysis script to monitor file behavior in a controlled environment.
  Example usage: python dynamic_analysis.py <file_path>
- **Prediction**: Use the trained model to predict whether a file is malicious or not.
  Example usage: python predict.py <file_path>

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- **Dependencies**: list all necessary libraries and their versions.
